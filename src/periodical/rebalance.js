/*
The most important job of the bank is to rebalance assets once in a while.
1. the bank finds who wants to insure their uninsured balances. They can learn automatically (given soft limit) or manually (Request Insurance in the wallet)
2. now the bank tries to find the total amount of insurance needed from the net-spenders who are currently online
3. it's up to the alg implementation to start disputes with net-spenders who are offline for too long
4. if bank fails to find enough net-spenders right now, they may drop some low value or high value net-receivers to match the numbers on both sides
5. packs withdrawals and deposits into one large rebalance batch and broadcasts onchain

Current implementation is super simple and straightforward. There's huge room for improvement:
* smart learning based on balances over time not on balance at the time of matching
* use as little withdrawals/deposits to transfer as much as possible volume
* have different schedule for different assets, e.g. rebalance FRD every 1 block but rare assets every 1k blocks
* often bank needs to request insurance from another bank (cross-bank payments).

General recommendations:
1. assets stuck in a dispute is a waste. It's better to do everything by mutual agreement as much as possible, w/o suffering dispute delays and locked up liquidity
2. the bank must store as little funds on their @onchain balances as possible. So once bank withdraw from net-spenders they should immediately deposit it to net-receiver.
